If you like programming and electronics, then you need to know the Arduino, now say he is already something very old, but it is very diverto play with it, and it is possible to make several super interesting things.

To buy an Arduino if you are starting recommend buying the one arduino R3 (this is mine), you can buy it in several stores (I will not indicate a specific order not to advertise: D), as a free market, ebay, aliexpress , among others.

After the Arduino, you can begin to follow tutorials on the internet, I got a book on good basic arduino with various projects and as I am completing the project will providing the code on my github (https://github.com/walternascimentobarroso/arduino-basico).

Then get your and amuse themselves.
