Markdown is a simple language markup originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Markdown converts your text into valid XHTML. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown "Description of wikipedia")

Today the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Official Documentation"), is used in several places (static sites, github, etc.), it is already being used as it already has some writing in their [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Official Documentation") and use editors to turn into html, a cool tool is the [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor "Online Tools"), also used just to see how will the mardown.

Another cool tool and use and really like is the [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/user.html "Official Site").

Now a bit of syntax
```
#Man title (h1)
##Sub title (h2)
###Less than the sub title (h3)
```
this stretch becomes this:
```
<h1>Man title (h1)</h1>
<h2>Sub title (h2)</h2>
<h3>Less than the sub title (h3)</h3>
```
Bold and italic
```
_italic_
**bold**
```
this becomes:
```
<em> italic </em>
<strong> bold </strong>
```

there are several commands, the best place to find all is the [Official Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "Official Documentation").
