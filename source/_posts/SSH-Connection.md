Every developer needs to know at least connect to the server via ssh, of course it's not easy to decorate various forms of program and languages and after years of trying to remember a simple command that is to connect via ssh to a machine to facilitate'm leaving unless the command main here in this post.
<!-- more -->

open the terminal and type
```
SSH login:senha@ipdamaquina
```
example
```
SSH walter:123@192.168.0.1
```
or you can connect without entering the password, and after finding the server he will ask for the password, example
```
SSH walter@192.168.0.1
```
simple and easy.
