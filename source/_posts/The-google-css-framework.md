Today we are used to create sites from a framework, the most widely used today is still the bootstrap, but of course there are many other competitors and one of them is [MDL](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html "Desginer Lite Material").
<!--more-->
The [MDL](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html "Material Desginer Lite") is very simple and is still in progress, each day brings new improvements, but of course we can already play with it a bit, and already is common free or professional projects using it.

To test the ideial is simply use the own official site documentation
http://www.getmdl.io/components/index.html

the ideal is to get it and hands-on, not the best tip, a cool example that I always end up using is the dashboard mdl that u can find in this link
